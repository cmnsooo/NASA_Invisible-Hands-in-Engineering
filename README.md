* train a model to predict earthquake onset times using deep learning
* calculate the weights


planet_sonic.py
* our final application
* feature 1 : play earthquake waves as a sound file, each for the earth, moon, mars
  - click 'View Analysis' button from the start menu
* feature 2 : show a customized planet from user's voice
  - click 'Explore' button from the start menu
  - click the mic icon to start recording
  - press enter key to finish recording
  - customized planet image from your voice data comes out through matplotpib plotting
* feature 3 : detect when the earthquake happens from the recorded voice data
  - assume that the decibel level corresponds to the velocity in seismic data
  - plot the expected earthquake onset times and decibel data using matplotlib


HOW TO USE :
  - since the .exe file doesn't work due to the compatibility issue between obspy & pyinstaller,
  - please run the planet_sonic.py file to execute the program
